# Implementation of  Generalized Structural and Positional Encoding

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha-SPE" />
learn a jointly node encoding which preserved both local node structural and global graph
structure in GTN

## Install
- The code is run with `dgl` library(https://docs.dgl.ai/).
- Due to the legacy code of `dgl`, several code base is run on `dgl==0.9.1` and others run on `dgl=1.0.0`
with or without GPU supports
- Support baseline:
    - Standard GNN models:
    - Graph Tranformer based models:
    
## Run
    
## TODO:
- [ ] Add running scripts for Experiments:
    - [ ] Table 1
    - [ ] Table 2
    - [ ] Table 3
    - [ ] Fig 2
    - [ ] Fig 3
    - [ ] Fig 4
- [ ] Remove deprecated api
- [ ] Add adaptive/learnt alpha
